# Star Wars Data Analysis Project
This project focuses on analyzing survey data related to the Star Wars movie franchise. Through guided exploration and analysis, the project develops key skills essential for performing data science tasks in real-world scenarios.

## Project Overview
When *The Force Awakens* was released, the team at [FiveThirtyEight](https://fivethirtyeight.datasettes.com/fivethirtyeight/star-wars-survey~2FStarWars/134) sought to answer intriguing questions about Star Wars fans. For instance:
**Does the rest of America realize that "The Empire Strikes Back" is the best movie in the series?**

The project involves working with survey data to uncover insights, including:

+ Identifying the **highest-ranked movie**.
+ Determining the **most-viewed movie**.


## Key Steps in the Project
1. **Importing Required Packages and Libraries**
The project uses Python, including libraries such as pandas, numpy, and matplotlib, for data manipulation and visualization.

2. **Accessing Data from the Source**
The raw data is sourced from a public survey conducted among Star Wars fans. Reference: **FiveThirtyEight** link above

3. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**
Performing EDA to understand the structure, trends, and peculiarities of the dataset.

4. **Data Cleaning and Munging**
Preparing the data for analysis is one of the most intensive tasks in the project. Given that the survey results contain inconsistencies and missing values, significant effort was required to clean and transform the data.

5. **Data Analysis**
Analyzing the cleaned data to address the project's core objectives:

   + **Finding the Highest-Ranked Movie**
   + **Finding the Most-Viewed Movie**


## Tools and Skills
This project is completed using Jupyter Notebook for interactive analysis. It demonstrates the use of key Python libraries such as pandas and matplotlib for data cleaning, transformation, and visualization.

Additionally, it illustrates the importance of utilizing external resources, such as:

+ Google
+ StackOverflow
+ Documentation for Python libraries
  
These are invaluable tools for solving challenges encountered during the project, and are extensively used by most professional data scientists.

## Why This Project?
This project helps in developing critical data science skills, including:

+ Understanding and working with raw data from real-world sources.

+ Data cleaning and transformation.

+ Drawing insights through EDA and data analysis.

By engaging in this project, it has been possible to tackle the complexities of real-world data science tasks.
