# Star Wars Movies Survey
## Project analysing Star Wars Survey Data 
This project uses Jupyter Notebook to analyze Star Wars movies.
The objective for the analysis is to be able to help Star Wars movies fans gain some factual knowledge and get answers to some questions about the whole franchise.
In particular, conclusive answer can be provided to the question "does the rest of America realize that “The Empire Strikes Back” is clearly the best of the bunch?"
